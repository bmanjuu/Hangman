Hello folks! 

This is my first attempt at making a CLI app using Ruby. 

As of 03/01/2016, I am working on having the program verify that user input is a letter and not a number or symbol. Eventually, I would like to make this program more interactive and interesting by adding a word bank, clues that guide the user throughout the game, and anything else that would make it more challenging or engaging for the user. 

Enjoy!
